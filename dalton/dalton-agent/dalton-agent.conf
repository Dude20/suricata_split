# Important! Sensor technology; the agent uses this value to alter its behavior as appropriate
# this should start with the engine name ('suricata' or 'snort'), followed by a dash followed
# by the version number.  This name must map directly to the engine configuration files on
# the Dalton controller. A value of 'auto' means that the agent will try to automatically
# determine this on startup (recommended). Examples:
# 'snort-2.9.9.0' for Snort 2.9.9.0; conf file 'snort-2.9.9.0.conf' on the Dalton controller
# 'suricata-4.0.0' for Suricata 4.0.0; conf file 'suricata-4.0.0.yaml' on the Dalton controller

# receives a job, it extracts the files, builds the config accordingly,
# runs the jobs, sends the results back, and then cleans up by deleting

# to keep the files (useful for debugging or seeing exactly what the
# sensor used to run a job).
